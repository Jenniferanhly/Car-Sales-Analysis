# Car-Sales-Analysis
# Overview: 
This project analyzes a dataset of used car prices to identify trends, insights, and patterns that can help in understanding the relationships between various attributes such as make, model, condition, selling price, and market value. The project utilizes SQL for data querying and Tableau for data visualization to build an interactive dashboard.

The dataset used contains details of car sales, including their MMR (Manheim Market Report) values, selling prices, odometer readings, condition ratings, and other characteristics.

Dataset Used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data
# Dataset: 
- year: Year of the car.
- make: Car manufacturer (e.g., Ford, BMW).
- model: Car model name.

- mmr: Manheim Market Report value (estimated market value).
- sellingprice: Final selling price of the car.
- saledate: Date the car was sold.
# Tableau Dashboard: 
The project also includes a Tableau dashboard to visualize the insights drawn from the data:
# Key Visualizations:
- Top Car Makes by Average Selling Price: Bar chart showing manufacturers with the highest average selling prices.
- Cars with the Largest Price Difference: A chart highlighting cars with the largest differences between their selling price and MMR value.
- Car Sales Count per State: A filled map showing the number of cars sold in each state.
- Top Colors Sold: Bar chart showing top colors sold when buying cars.
- Top Car Body Types Sold: A pie chart highlighting the percentages of body types sold.
# Conclusion: 
In this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of car price data, using SQL for querying and Tableau for visualizing trends. Through our exploration, several key insights were uncovered:

- Top Car Makes: The most expensive car brands in terms of average selling price included high-end luxury brands like Rolls-Royce, Ferrari, and Maserati. These brands consistently fetched higher prices, reflecting their exclusivity and premium quality.

- Sales by State: Certain states, such as California, Texas, and Florida dominated car sales. This could be attributed to larger markets, economic conditions, or regional preferences for certain car types.

- Body Types Sold: The analysis revealed that SUVs and sedans were the most popular body types, representing the majority of car sales. SUVs, in particular, were highly favored across various price ranges due to their versatility and demand in both urban and rural areas.

- Popular Colors: When examining color preferences, black, white, and silver emerged as the most commonly sold colors. These neutral shades are typically associated with higher resale value and broader market appeal, making them the dominant choices among buyers.

These findings can assist car dealerships, buyers, and sellers in making more informed decisions. Future work could include building predictive models to estimate car prices and expanding the analysis with more variables such as fuel type, engine size, or market trends.
